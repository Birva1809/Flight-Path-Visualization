# Flight Path Visualization  

This project focuses on visualizing flight paths using both historical data and live flight tracking. The goal is to analyze and display flight routes interactively using Python-based visualization libraries.

## Features  
- **Historical Flight Data Visualization**: Analyze and map historical flight routes.  
- **Live Flight Tracking** (Upcoming): Display real-time flight paths.  
- **Interactive Maps**: Use tools like `plotly`, `folium`, and `geopandas` for dynamic visualizations.  

## Installation  
Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:  
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly geopandas cartopy
