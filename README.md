# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Path Visualizer
# Project By: [Birva Dave](https://www.linkedin.com/in/birva-dave/)


This project is a visual exploration of global flight routes using both historical data and live tracking (upcoming). It combines geographical visualizations, real-world datasets, and interactive elements to make flight patterns insightful and engaging.

## üîç What It Does

- Visualizes **historical airline routes** on an interactive world map.
- Allows **filtering by airline and country** to explore specific patterns.
- Plans to integrate **real-time flight tracking** using open aviation APIs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python** (Data processing, backend)
- **Dash** + **Plotly** (Interactive web-based visualizations)
- **GeoPandas**, **Cartopy** (Geographical plotting)
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** (Data manipulation)

## Installation  
Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:  
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly geopandas cartopy
```
